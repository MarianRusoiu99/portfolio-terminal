                <p>
                    Developed a command-line tool that automates cross-browser visual regression testing by comparing how websites render across 
                    Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, generating detailed visual difference reports with metrics and screenshots.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Designed and implemented a modular architecture (CLI, Executor, ScreenshotService, DiffService, ReportService) 
                    to ensure maintainability and scalability.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Utilized Playwright to orchestrate multi-browser sessions and capture full-page screenshots with automatic page 
                    readiness detection (images, fonts, network idle).
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Built a pixel-perfect diff engine using Pixelmatch, detecting even minimal rendering inconsistencies between browsers.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Created a dynamic HTML reporting system with EJS templates, including side-by-side visual comparisons, 
                    diff metrics, and browser metadata.
